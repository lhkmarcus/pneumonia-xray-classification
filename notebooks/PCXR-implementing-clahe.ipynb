    "# Implementing Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation on CXR Images\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to implement the **CLAHE** technique on the CXR images to evaluate whether the increased contrast will benefit model generalisability to new data. Image segmentation will be evaluated as well, if feasible.\n",
    " \n",
    "Once trained and evaluated, each version of the network will be further evaluated with the **GRAD-CAM** framework to visualise the regions of importance in the images. This will be observed in a separate notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment tracking will be conducted with the *Weights and Biases* platform. \n",
